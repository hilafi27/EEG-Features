# EEG-Features
We downloaded the EEG data we found from Kaggle.( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/eeg-psychiatric-disorders-dataset )

The accuracy of machine learning that we used directly using this data was very low.

We used some features to increase this accuracy.

These codes also include the calculation and filing of those features.

Features:
Variance
Standard deviation
Mean
Skewness
Kurtosis
Hjort-Activity
Hjort-Complexity
Hjort-Mobility
Wavelet-Frequency
